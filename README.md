Just another repository
I am a civil engineer with a passion for figuring out how things work. I love to learn about everything I can get my hands on. It is both a blessing and a curse. Computer science has always interested me, but never had the time to focus on it. For the last year I have been making up for lost time and learing as much as I can about computers.
